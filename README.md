# Project 1: A model for fraud detection in card transactions
* This project tries to develop models that could allow predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, through the analysis and manipulation of a database that contains information on 590,540 transactions carried out online through the Vesta platform. 
* The project evaluates the most relevant variables to predict the veracity of a transaction, builds models and selects the one that best fits the data.
* As a general conclusion, it was identified that the classification algorithms of XGBClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier and Random Forest are the ones that best fit the data, giving rise to a deeper development of this type of models in future works. 
* For its further application, the distribution of the target variable must be taken into account, and ensure that the dataframe to be used in the modelling is balanced.
* Once the modelling process has been improved, the next task would be the development of algorithms that, based on the prediction of the veracity of a transaction, instruct mechanical tasks for its validation by the user. An example would be developing an application that automatically checks with the user if they are carrying out the transaction in question.
