# Project 1: A model for fraud detection in card transactions
* This project tries to develop models that could allow predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, through the analysis and manipulation of a database that contains information on 590,540 transactions carried out online through the Vesta platform. 
* The project evaluates the most relevant variables to predict the veracity of a transaction, builds models and selects the one that best fits the data.
